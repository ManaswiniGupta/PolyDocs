# PDF Bot with Multiple Document Processing using Groq

## Overview

This project is a PDF bot that processes multiple PDF documents simultaneously using Groq for parallel processing and optimization. The bot extracts, processes, and analyzes content from PDFs efficiently, thanks to Groq's acceleration technology.

## Features

- **Parallel PDF Processing**: Leverages Groq's hardware to handle multiple PDF files at the same time.
- **Content Extraction**: Extracts text, images, and metadata from PDFs.
- **Scalable Performance**: Optimized for handling large datasets of PDFs quickly and efficiently.
- **Groq Integration**: Utilizes Groq's highly parallel architecture to accelerate processing tasks.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible to add new features such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, or any other NLP tasks on the PDF content.
